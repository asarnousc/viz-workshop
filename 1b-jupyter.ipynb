    " - Code cells can be executed in the current state of the kernel and output its result. \n",

    " - Text cells can be \"executed\" (same shortcuts) to render their formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - A cell that has not been executed has a `[ ]` before it\n",
    " - After execution, each cell is given an index, turning `[ ]` into `[n]`, where `n` is the cell's execution order\n",
    " - A cell currently in execution has `[*]` before it. Multiple cells can be queued for execution, all having `[*]` before them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - While writing code, `tab` completion is available.\n",
    " - When calling a function, after the opening bracket `shift+tab` shows its docstring (arguments, default values, examples, etc).\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - Multiple cells can be selected (using `shift`), and cell operations are then performed on all of them.\n",
    " - When multiple cells are being scheduled to be executed, they will run in order. Execution stops when one of them raises an error.\n",
    " - The [Run] menu (at the top) contains options to run all cells above/below selected one.\n",
    " - More Vim-inspired shortcuts are available for navigation, such as **`j`** and **`k`**."
